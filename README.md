# godot-morpg
A simple 2D MORPG made with Godot.
It uses a dedicated Godot server (client and server are separate game projects) along with a NodeJS REST API to handle logins and other stuff.

This is just a hobby project (that might become super awesome!), mostly for learning.

*This is an ongoing development and things will most likely not work. Not meant to be used by others, yet. I'm keeping it public though in case anyone finds it interesting!*
